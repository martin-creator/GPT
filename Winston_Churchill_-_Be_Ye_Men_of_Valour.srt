1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,680
I speak to you for the first time as Prime Minister in a solemn hour for the life of our country,

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,880
of our empire, of our allies, and above all of the cause of freedom.

3
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:20,240
A tremendous battle is raging in France and flanders.

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,920
The Germans by a remarkable combination of air bombing and heavily armored tanks

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,520
have broken through the French defenses north of the Maginot line and strong columns of

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:42,080
their armored vehicles are ravaging the open country which for the first day or two was without

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:48,640
defenders. They have penetrated deeply and spread alarm and confusion in their track.

8
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,480
Behind them there are now appearing infantry in lorries and behind them again the large masses

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:04,400
are moving forward. The regroupment of the French armies to make head again and also to strike

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:13,360
at this intruding wedge has been proceeding for several days largely assisted by the magnificent

11
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:21,520
efforts of the Royal Air Force. We must not allow ourselves to be intimidated by the presence

12
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,920
of the armored vehicles in unexpected places behind our lines. If they are behind our front

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:37,280
the French are also at many points fighting actively behind there. Both sides are therefore in an

14
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:45,520
extremely dangerous position and if the French army and our own army are well handled and I believe

15
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,160
they will be if the French retain that genius for recovery and counterattack which they have

16
00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:01,120
so long been famous and if the British army shows the doggyed endurance and solid fighting power

17
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:08,560
of which there have been so many examples in the past then a sudden transformation of the scene

18
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:16,800
might spring into being. It would be foolish however to disguise the gravity of the hour.

19
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,160
It would be still more foolish to loot heart and courage or to suppose that well trained well

20
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:31,360
equipped armies numbering three or four millions of men can be overcome in the space of a few weeks

21
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,600
or even months by a scoop or raid of mechanized vehicles however formidable.

22
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,480
We may look with confidence to the stabilization of the front in front and to the general

23
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,240
engagement of the masses which will enable the qualities of the French and British soldiers

24
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:54,400
to be matched squarely against those of their adversaries.

25
00:02:54,880 --> 00:03:03,600
For myself I have invincible confidence in the French army and its leaders only a very small part

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:11,440
of that splendid army and yet been heavily engaged and only a very small part of France had yet

27
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,840
been invaded. There is good evidence to show that practically the whole of the specialized and

28
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,840
mechanized forces of the enemy have been already thrown into the battle and we know that very

29
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:32,000
heavy losses have been inflicted upon them. No officer or man, no brigade or division which

30
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:37,600
grapples at close quarters with the enemy wherever encountered can fail to make a worthy

31
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:44,800
contribution to the general result. The armies must cast away the idea of resisting attack

32
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:52,080
behind concrete lines or natural obstacles and must realize that mastery can only be regained

33
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:59,440
by furious and unrelenting assault and this spirit must not only animate the high command

34
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:09,120
but must inspire every fighting man. In the air, often at serious odds, often at odds,

35
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,760
to the two who thought overwhelming, we have been clawing down three or four to one of our enemy

36
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,680
and the relative balance of the British and German air forces is now considerably more

37
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:28,480
favorable to us than at the beginning of the battle. In cutting down the German bombers,

38
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:34,720
we are fighting our own battle as well as that of France. My confidence in our ability to fight

39
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,400
it out to the finish with the German air force has been strengthened by the fierce encounters

40
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,200
which have taken place and are taking place. At the same time, our heavy bombers are striking

41
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,240
nightly at the taproot of German mechanized power and have already inflicted serious damage

42
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,720
upon the oil refineries on which the Nazi effort to dominate the world directly depends.

43
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:07,600
We must expect that as soon as stability is reached on the western front,

44
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,320
the bulk of that hideous apparatus of aggression which dashed Holland into ruin and slavery

45
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:22,880
in a few days will be turned upon us. I am sure I speak for all when I say we are ready to face it,

46
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:31,600
to endure it and to retaliate against it, to any extent that the unwritten laws of war permit.

47
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,600
There will be many men and many women in this island who when the ordeal comes upon them

48
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,480
and come it will will feel comfort and even a pride that they are sharing the perils of our

49
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:53,200
leds at the front. Soldiers, sailors and airmen, God bless them and are drawing away for them a

50
00:05:53,200 --> 00:06:01,280
part at least of the onslaught they have to bear. He is not this the appointed time for all to make

51
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:08,320
the utmost exertions in their power. If the battle is to be won, we must provide our men with

52
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:15,040
ever increasing quantities of the weapons and ammunition they need. We must have and have quickly

53
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:21,920
more aeroplanes, more tanks, more shells, more guns. There is imperious need for these vital

54
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:28,400
munitions. They increase our strength against the powerfully armed enemy. They replace the wastage

55
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:36,000
of the obstinate struggle and the knowledge that wastage will speedily be replaced enables us to

56
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,280
draw more readily upon our reserves and throw them in now that everything counts so much. Our task

57
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:50,080
is not only to win the battle but to win the war. After this battle in France abates its force,

58
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:58,640
there will come the battle for our islands, for all that Britain is and all that Britain means

59
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:06,560
that will be the struggle. In that supreme emergency, we shall not hesitate to take every step,

60
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:14,080
even the most drastic to call forth from our people the last ounce and the last inch of effort

61
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:20,240
of which they are capable. The interests of property, the hours of labor are nothing compared to

62
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:25,200
the struggle for life and honor, for right and freedom to which we have vowed ourselves.

63
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:32,720
I have received from the chiefs of the French Republic and in particular from its

64
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:41,760
indomitable Prime Minister, Monsieur Reino, the most sacred pledges that whatever happens they will

65
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:50,800
fight to the end be it bitter nor be it glorious. No, if we fight to the end it can only be glorious.

66
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,920
Having received its majesty's commission, I have formed an administration of men and women

67
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:04,640
of every party and of almost every point of view. We have differed and quarreled in the past

68
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:14,080
that now one bound unite us at all. The wage war until victory is won and never to surrender

69
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,840
ourselves to servitude and shame, whatever the cost and the agony may be.

70
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,520
This is one of the most awestriking periods in the long history of France and Britain.

71
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:36,000
It is also beyond doubt the most sublime, side by side, unaided except by their

72
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,680
kitten kin in the great dominions and by the wide empires which rest beneath their shield,

73
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:49,840
side by side the British and French peoples have advanced to rescue not only Europe but mankind

74
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:58,080
from the foulest and most soul-destroying tyranny which has ever darkened and stained the pages

75
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:09,440
of history. Behind us, behind the armies and fleets of Britain and France gather a group of

76
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:17,120
shattered states and bludgeoned races, the checks, the polls, the Norwegians, the Danes,

77
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:24,960
the Dutch, the Belgians, upon all of whom the long night of barbarism will descend unbroken

78
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:32,800
even by a star of hope unless we conquer as conquer we must, as conquer we shall.

79
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:36,880
Today is Trinity Sunday.

80
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:46,400
Century to go words were written to be a call and a spur to the faithful servants of truth and justice.

81
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:56,560
Arm yourselves and be men of valor and be in readiness for the conflict for it is better for us

82
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:04,880
to perish in battle than to look upon the outrage of our nation and our altars as the will of God

83
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:10,080
is in heaven, even so let him do.
