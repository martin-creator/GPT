00:00.000 --> 00:07.680
I speak to you for the first time as Prime Minister in a solemn hour for the life of our country,

00:08.320 --> 00:14.880
of our empire, of our allies, and above all of the cause of freedom.

00:16.640 --> 00:20.240
A tremendous battle is raging in France and flanders.

00:21.920 --> 00:27.920
The Germans by a remarkable combination of air bombing and heavily armored tanks

00:28.720 --> 00:35.520
have broken through the French defenses north of the Maginot line and strong columns of

00:35.520 --> 00:42.080
their armored vehicles are ravaging the open country which for the first day or two was without

00:42.080 --> 00:48.640
defenders. They have penetrated deeply and spread alarm and confusion in their track.

00:50.000 --> 00:56.480
Behind them there are now appearing infantry in lorries and behind them again the large masses

00:56.480 --> 01:04.400
are moving forward. The regroupment of the French armies to make head again and also to strike

01:04.400 --> 01:13.360
at this intruding wedge has been proceeding for several days largely assisted by the magnificent

01:13.360 --> 01:21.520
efforts of the Royal Air Force. We must not allow ourselves to be intimidated by the presence

01:21.520 --> 01:27.920
of the armored vehicles in unexpected places behind our lines. If they are behind our front

01:28.640 --> 01:37.280
the French are also at many points fighting actively behind there. Both sides are therefore in an

01:37.280 --> 01:45.520
extremely dangerous position and if the French army and our own army are well handled and I believe

01:45.520 --> 01:52.160
they will be if the French retain that genius for recovery and counterattack which they have

01:52.880 --> 02:01.120
so long been famous and if the British army shows the doggyed endurance and solid fighting power

02:01.120 --> 02:08.560
of which there have been so many examples in the past then a sudden transformation of the scene

02:08.640 --> 02:16.800
might spring into being. It would be foolish however to disguise the gravity of the hour.

02:18.480 --> 02:24.160
It would be still more foolish to loot heart and courage or to suppose that well trained well

02:24.160 --> 02:31.360
equipped armies numbering three or four millions of men can be overcome in the space of a few weeks

02:31.360 --> 02:37.600
or even months by a scoop or raid of mechanized vehicles however formidable.

02:38.800 --> 02:44.480
We may look with confidence to the stabilization of the front in front and to the general

02:44.480 --> 02:50.240
engagement of the masses which will enable the qualities of the French and British soldiers

02:50.240 --> 02:54.400
to be matched squarely against those of their adversaries.

02:54.880 --> 03:03.600
For myself I have invincible confidence in the French army and its leaders only a very small part

03:03.600 --> 03:11.440
of that splendid army and yet been heavily engaged and only a very small part of France had yet

03:11.440 --> 03:17.840
been invaded. There is good evidence to show that practically the whole of the specialized and

03:17.840 --> 03:23.840
mechanized forces of the enemy have been already thrown into the battle and we know that very

03:23.920 --> 03:32.000
heavy losses have been inflicted upon them. No officer or man, no brigade or division which

03:32.000 --> 03:37.600
grapples at close quarters with the enemy wherever encountered can fail to make a worthy

03:37.600 --> 03:44.800
contribution to the general result. The armies must cast away the idea of resisting attack

03:44.800 --> 03:52.080
behind concrete lines or natural obstacles and must realize that mastery can only be regained

03:52.160 --> 03:59.440
by furious and unrelenting assault and this spirit must not only animate the high command

03:59.440 --> 04:09.120
but must inspire every fighting man. In the air, often at serious odds, often at odds,

04:09.120 --> 04:15.760
to the two who thought overwhelming, we have been clawing down three or four to one of our enemy

04:17.040 --> 04:21.680
and the relative balance of the British and German air forces is now considerably more

04:21.680 --> 04:28.480
favorable to us than at the beginning of the battle. In cutting down the German bombers,

04:28.480 --> 04:34.720
we are fighting our own battle as well as that of France. My confidence in our ability to fight

04:34.720 --> 04:40.400
it out to the finish with the German air force has been strengthened by the fierce encounters

04:40.400 --> 04:47.200
which have taken place and are taking place. At the same time, our heavy bombers are striking

04:47.280 --> 04:54.240
nightly at the taproot of German mechanized power and have already inflicted serious damage

04:54.240 --> 05:00.720
upon the oil refineries on which the Nazi effort to dominate the world directly depends.

05:02.480 --> 05:07.600
We must expect that as soon as stability is reached on the western front,

05:08.400 --> 05:14.320
the bulk of that hideous apparatus of aggression which dashed Holland into ruin and slavery

05:14.400 --> 05:22.880
in a few days will be turned upon us. I am sure I speak for all when I say we are ready to face it,

05:23.840 --> 05:31.600
to endure it and to retaliate against it, to any extent that the unwritten laws of war permit.

05:32.880 --> 05:39.600
There will be many men and many women in this island who when the ordeal comes upon them

05:39.680 --> 05:46.480
and come it will will feel comfort and even a pride that they are sharing the perils of our

05:46.480 --> 05:53.200
leds at the front. Soldiers, sailors and airmen, God bless them and are drawing away for them a

05:53.200 --> 06:01.280
part at least of the onslaught they have to bear. He is not this the appointed time for all to make

06:01.280 --> 06:08.320
the utmost exertions in their power. If the battle is to be won, we must provide our men with

06:08.320 --> 06:15.040
ever increasing quantities of the weapons and ammunition they need. We must have and have quickly

06:15.040 --> 06:21.920
more aeroplanes, more tanks, more shells, more guns. There is imperious need for these vital

06:21.920 --> 06:28.400
munitions. They increase our strength against the powerfully armed enemy. They replace the wastage

06:28.400 --> 06:36.000
of the obstinate struggle and the knowledge that wastage will speedily be replaced enables us to

06:36.000 --> 06:43.280
draw more readily upon our reserves and throw them in now that everything counts so much. Our task

06:43.280 --> 06:50.080
is not only to win the battle but to win the war. After this battle in France abates its force,

06:51.040 --> 06:58.640
there will come the battle for our islands, for all that Britain is and all that Britain means

06:59.360 --> 07:06.560
that will be the struggle. In that supreme emergency, we shall not hesitate to take every step,

07:06.560 --> 07:14.080
even the most drastic to call forth from our people the last ounce and the last inch of effort

07:14.080 --> 07:20.240
of which they are capable. The interests of property, the hours of labor are nothing compared to

07:20.240 --> 07:25.200
the struggle for life and honor, for right and freedom to which we have vowed ourselves.

07:25.600 --> 07:32.720
I have received from the chiefs of the French Republic and in particular from its

07:33.680 --> 07:41.760
indomitable Prime Minister, Monsieur Reino, the most sacred pledges that whatever happens they will

07:41.760 --> 07:50.800
fight to the end be it bitter nor be it glorious. No, if we fight to the end it can only be glorious.

07:51.760 --> 07:57.920
Having received its majesty's commission, I have formed an administration of men and women

07:57.920 --> 08:04.640
of every party and of almost every point of view. We have differed and quarreled in the past

08:05.600 --> 08:14.080
that now one bound unite us at all. The wage war until victory is won and never to surrender

08:14.160 --> 08:19.840
ourselves to servitude and shame, whatever the cost and the agony may be.

08:21.120 --> 08:27.520
This is one of the most awestriking periods in the long history of France and Britain.

08:28.160 --> 08:36.000
It is also beyond doubt the most sublime, side by side, unaided except by their

08:36.000 --> 08:41.680
kitten kin in the great dominions and by the wide empires which rest beneath their shield,

08:42.000 --> 08:49.840
side by side the British and French peoples have advanced to rescue not only Europe but mankind

08:50.480 --> 08:58.080
from the foulest and most soul-destroying tyranny which has ever darkened and stained the pages

08:58.080 --> 09:09.440
of history. Behind us, behind the armies and fleets of Britain and France gather a group of

09:09.440 --> 09:17.120
shattered states and bludgeoned races, the checks, the polls, the Norwegians, the Danes,

09:17.120 --> 09:24.960
the Dutch, the Belgians, upon all of whom the long night of barbarism will descend unbroken

09:24.960 --> 09:32.800
even by a star of hope unless we conquer as conquer we must, as conquer we shall.

09:32.960 --> 09:36.880
Today is Trinity Sunday.

09:38.400 --> 09:46.400
Century to go words were written to be a call and a spur to the faithful servants of truth and justice.

09:48.640 --> 09:56.560
Arm yourselves and be men of valor and be in readiness for the conflict for it is better for us

09:56.560 --> 10:04.880
to perish in battle than to look upon the outrage of our nation and our altars as the will of God

10:04.880 --> 10:10.080
is in heaven, even so let him do.
