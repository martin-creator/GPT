1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
What is such a characteristic of life?

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:05,000
What do we achieve in the future?

3
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:12,000
This is a new government that could not understand everything in a big country.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The future of it is influenced by your work.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Every country has more and more of it.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,000
The state of the system, the government of the state,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,000
as well as the nation, the rich or the country,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
and you are the first and the first government of the state.

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
We are present in the mass media,

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
as well as in the class, which the capitalist gave us.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Even the most democratic, even the most free republic,

12
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:44,000
until the state of the capitalist gave us a place

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
in which the state of the state controls the small states,

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
which are the states of the 90s,

15
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,000
and the capitalist states were the first to give us the first time.

16
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,000
The state of the country has a place to be built,

17
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,000
where only the workers, only the citizens,

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
can make the governor,

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
and they give us the power to organize the events

20
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
and the interests of the state of the country.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The last one,

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,740
how

23
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,740
you can afford to leave the country,

24
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,580
when you are a very poor,

25
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,100
you have to have a very poor,

26
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,800
you have to leave your country,

27
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,240
the place is not only known,

28
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,300
but also popular ones,

29
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,560
saltwater for production for every country,

30
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,800
and why the state of the wing,

31
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,880
which you would not be considered the future of,

32
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,300
the surrounding communism,

33
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,460
and the state of the wing.

34
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,780
The Soviet forces are federal,

35
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,480
and this is a human race.

36
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:55,820
They are interested in the emergence of the German forces,

37
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,760
not culture,

38
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:00,800
the domestic wars,

39
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:04,180
the domesticï¿½ and Granite civilization.

40
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,100
But in order to have a chance,

41
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,180
law of socialism,

42
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:10,820
the alternative is that of the possibility of the future,

43
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,280
who will take the people and principal,

44
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,140
the use of their weapons,

45
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,180
the laws of the state,

46
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,060
the government of the government of the government of the state,

47
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,620
the Soviet authorities,

48
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,380
the local socialism,

49
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,480
the country's citizens,

50
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,020
the authorities of the state,

51
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,320
the people of the state,

52
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,820
and the people of the poor.
