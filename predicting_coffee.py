# When a user enters the name of a coffee, we will use the OpenAI Embeddings API to get the
# embedding for the review text of that coffee. Then, we will calculate the cosine similarity between
# the input coffee review and all other reviews in the dataset. The reviews with the highest cosine
# similarity scores will be the most similar to the input coffeeâ€™s review. We will then print the names
# of the most similar coffees to the user.
