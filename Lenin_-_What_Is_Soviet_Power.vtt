00:00.000 --> 00:03.000
What is such a characteristic of life?

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
What do we achieve in the future?

00:05.000 --> 00:12.000
This is a new government that could not understand everything in a big country.

00:12.000 --> 00:16.000
The future of it is influenced by your work.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.000
Every country has more and more of it.

00:18.000 --> 00:22.000
The state of the system, the government of the state,

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
as well as the nation, the rich or the country,

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
and you are the first and the first government of the state.

00:29.000 --> 00:31.000
We are present in the mass media,

00:31.000 --> 00:35.000
as well as in the class, which the capitalist gave us.

00:35.000 --> 00:40.000
Even the most democratic, even the most free republic,

00:40.000 --> 00:44.000
until the state of the capitalist gave us a place

00:44.000 --> 00:48.000
in which the state of the state controls the small states,

00:48.000 --> 00:51.000
which are the states of the 90s,

00:51.000 --> 00:55.000
and the capitalist states were the first to give us the first time.

00:55.000 --> 00:59.000
The state of the country has a place to be built,

00:59.000 --> 01:03.000
where only the workers, only the citizens,

01:03.000 --> 01:06.000
can make the governor,

01:06.000 --> 01:08.000
and they give us the power to organize the events

01:08.000 --> 01:12.000
and the interests of the state of the country.

01:12.000 --> 01:14.000
The last one,

01:14.000 --> 01:18.740
how

01:18.740 --> 01:20.740
you can afford to leave the country,

01:21.560 --> 01:23.580
when you are a very poor,

01:23.580 --> 01:26.100
you have to have a very poor,

01:26.100 --> 01:28.800
you have to leave your country,

01:28.800 --> 01:31.240
the place is not only known,

01:31.240 --> 01:34.300
but also popular ones,

01:34.300 --> 01:36.560
saltwater for production for every country,

01:36.560 --> 01:40.800
and why the state of the wing,

01:40.800 --> 01:44.880
which you would not be considered the future of,

01:44.880 --> 01:46.300
the surrounding communism,

01:46.300 --> 01:48.460
and the state of the wing.

01:48.480 --> 01:50.780
The Soviet forces are federal,

01:50.780 --> 01:52.480
and this is a human race.

01:52.480 --> 01:55.820
They are interested in the emergence of the German forces,

01:55.820 --> 01:58.760
not culture,

01:58.760 --> 02:00.800
the domestic wars,

02:00.800 --> 02:04.180
the domesticï¿½ and Granite civilization.

02:04.180 --> 02:06.100
But in order to have a chance,

02:06.100 --> 02:08.180
law of socialism,

02:08.180 --> 02:10.820
the alternative is that of the possibility of the future,

02:10.820 --> 02:13.280
who will take the people and principal,

02:13.280 --> 02:16.140
the use of their weapons,

02:16.140 --> 02:18.180
the laws of the state,

02:18.180 --> 02:22.060
the government of the government of the government of the state,

02:22.060 --> 02:23.620
the Soviet authorities,

02:23.620 --> 02:25.380
the local socialism,

02:25.380 --> 02:26.480
the country's citizens,

02:26.480 --> 02:28.020
the authorities of the state,

02:28.020 --> 02:29.320
the people of the state,

02:29.320 --> 02:30.820
and the people of the poor.
