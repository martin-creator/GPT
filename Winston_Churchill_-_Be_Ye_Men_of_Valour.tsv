0	7680	I speak to you for the first time as Prime Minister in a solemn hour for the life of our country,
8320	14880	of our empire, of our allies, and above all of the cause of freedom.
16640	20240	A tremendous battle is raging in France and flanders.
21920	27920	The Germans by a remarkable combination of air bombing and heavily armored tanks
28720	35520	have broken through the French defenses north of the Maginot line and strong columns of
35520	42080	their armored vehicles are ravaging the open country which for the first day or two was without
42080	48640	defenders. They have penetrated deeply and spread alarm and confusion in their track.
50000	56480	Behind them there are now appearing infantry in lorries and behind them again the large masses
56480	64400	are moving forward. The regroupment of the French armies to make head again and also to strike
64400	73360	at this intruding wedge has been proceeding for several days largely assisted by the magnificent
73360	81520	efforts of the Royal Air Force. We must not allow ourselves to be intimidated by the presence
81520	87920	of the armored vehicles in unexpected places behind our lines. If they are behind our front
88640	97280	the French are also at many points fighting actively behind there. Both sides are therefore in an
97280	105520	extremely dangerous position and if the French army and our own army are well handled and I believe
105520	112160	they will be if the French retain that genius for recovery and counterattack which they have
112880	121120	so long been famous and if the British army shows the doggyed endurance and solid fighting power
121120	128560	of which there have been so many examples in the past then a sudden transformation of the scene
128640	136800	might spring into being. It would be foolish however to disguise the gravity of the hour.
138480	144160	It would be still more foolish to loot heart and courage or to suppose that well trained well
144160	151360	equipped armies numbering three or four millions of men can be overcome in the space of a few weeks
151360	157600	or even months by a scoop or raid of mechanized vehicles however formidable.
158800	164480	We may look with confidence to the stabilization of the front in front and to the general
164480	170240	engagement of the masses which will enable the qualities of the French and British soldiers
170240	174400	to be matched squarely against those of their adversaries.
174880	183600	For myself I have invincible confidence in the French army and its leaders only a very small part
183600	191440	of that splendid army and yet been heavily engaged and only a very small part of France had yet
191440	197840	been invaded. There is good evidence to show that practically the whole of the specialized and
197840	203840	mechanized forces of the enemy have been already thrown into the battle and we know that very
203920	212000	heavy losses have been inflicted upon them. No officer or man, no brigade or division which
212000	217600	grapples at close quarters with the enemy wherever encountered can fail to make a worthy
217600	224800	contribution to the general result. The armies must cast away the idea of resisting attack
224800	232080	behind concrete lines or natural obstacles and must realize that mastery can only be regained
232160	239440	by furious and unrelenting assault and this spirit must not only animate the high command
239440	249120	but must inspire every fighting man. In the air, often at serious odds, often at odds,
249120	255760	to the two who thought overwhelming, we have been clawing down three or four to one of our enemy
257040	261680	and the relative balance of the British and German air forces is now considerably more
261680	268480	favorable to us than at the beginning of the battle. In cutting down the German bombers,
268480	274720	we are fighting our own battle as well as that of France. My confidence in our ability to fight
274720	280400	it out to the finish with the German air force has been strengthened by the fierce encounters
280400	287200	which have taken place and are taking place. At the same time, our heavy bombers are striking
287280	294240	nightly at the taproot of German mechanized power and have already inflicted serious damage
294240	300720	upon the oil refineries on which the Nazi effort to dominate the world directly depends.
302480	307600	We must expect that as soon as stability is reached on the western front,
308400	314320	the bulk of that hideous apparatus of aggression which dashed Holland into ruin and slavery
314400	322880	in a few days will be turned upon us. I am sure I speak for all when I say we are ready to face it,
323840	331600	to endure it and to retaliate against it, to any extent that the unwritten laws of war permit.
332880	339600	There will be many men and many women in this island who when the ordeal comes upon them
339680	346480	and come it will will feel comfort and even a pride that they are sharing the perils of our
346480	353200	leds at the front. Soldiers, sailors and airmen, God bless them and are drawing away for them a
353200	361280	part at least of the onslaught they have to bear. He is not this the appointed time for all to make
361280	368320	the utmost exertions in their power. If the battle is to be won, we must provide our men with
368320	375040	ever increasing quantities of the weapons and ammunition they need. We must have and have quickly
375040	381920	more aeroplanes, more tanks, more shells, more guns. There is imperious need for these vital
381920	388400	munitions. They increase our strength against the powerfully armed enemy. They replace the wastage
388400	396000	of the obstinate struggle and the knowledge that wastage will speedily be replaced enables us to
396000	403280	draw more readily upon our reserves and throw them in now that everything counts so much. Our task
403280	410080	is not only to win the battle but to win the war. After this battle in France abates its force,
411040	418640	there will come the battle for our islands, for all that Britain is and all that Britain means
419360	426560	that will be the struggle. In that supreme emergency, we shall not hesitate to take every step,
426560	434080	even the most drastic to call forth from our people the last ounce and the last inch of effort
434080	440240	of which they are capable. The interests of property, the hours of labor are nothing compared to
440240	445200	the struggle for life and honor, for right and freedom to which we have vowed ourselves.
445600	452720	I have received from the chiefs of the French Republic and in particular from its
453680	461760	indomitable Prime Minister, Monsieur Reino, the most sacred pledges that whatever happens they will
461760	470800	fight to the end be it bitter nor be it glorious. No, if we fight to the end it can only be glorious.
471760	477920	Having received its majesty's commission, I have formed an administration of men and women
477920	484640	of every party and of almost every point of view. We have differed and quarreled in the past
485600	494080	that now one bound unite us at all. The wage war until victory is won and never to surrender
494160	499840	ourselves to servitude and shame, whatever the cost and the agony may be.
501120	507520	This is one of the most awestriking periods in the long history of France and Britain.
508160	516000	It is also beyond doubt the most sublime, side by side, unaided except by their
516000	521680	kitten kin in the great dominions and by the wide empires which rest beneath their shield,
522000	529840	side by side the British and French peoples have advanced to rescue not only Europe but mankind
530480	538080	from the foulest and most soul-destroying tyranny which has ever darkened and stained the pages
538080	549440	of history. Behind us, behind the armies and fleets of Britain and France gather a group of
549440	557120	shattered states and bludgeoned races, the checks, the polls, the Norwegians, the Danes,
557120	564960	the Dutch, the Belgians, upon all of whom the long night of barbarism will descend unbroken
564960	572800	even by a star of hope unless we conquer as conquer we must, as conquer we shall.
572960	576880	Today is Trinity Sunday.
578400	586400	Century to go words were written to be a call and a spur to the faithful servants of truth and justice.
588640	596560	Arm yourselves and be men of valor and be in readiness for the conflict for it is better for us
596560	604880	to perish in battle than to look upon the outrage of our nation and our altars as the will of God
604880	610080	is in heaven, even so let him do.
